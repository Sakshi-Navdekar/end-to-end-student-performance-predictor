# End-to-End-Project: Student-Performance-Predictor

Company: Cotech IT Solution

"Intern ID": CT1MTDG2454

"Domain": Data Science

"Duration": 4 weeks

"Mentor": Neela Santosh

"Description":This project is a complete data science pipeline that predicts student performance based on study hours and attendance. It starts with collecting and preprocessing data to ensure it is clean and ready for modeling. A regression model is then trained to predict exam scores, and the trained model is saved for deployment. Using FastAPI, the project provides a web app where users can input study hours and attendance to get an instant prediction of the expected score. The app includes a user-friendly web form and interactive API documentation, making it easy to test and understand the modelâ€™s functionality. This project demonstrates the full workflow from data collection and modeling to deploying an accessible, working API.
